    <dt><em>Plagiarism</em></dt>
    <dd>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional reputation of
        others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments in this class are to be
        completed and turned in on an individual basis. Even in the software industry, where most projects are done in a
        team environment, team members are expected to contribute substantial original effort to their assigned
        portion(s) of a project. Information technology professionals are expected to work to a high professional and
        ethical standard.</dd>
    <dd>The bottom line: You will not gain any benefit from this course if someone else is doing all the work and
        thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build upon this one nor will it
        help you get ahead in the workplace!</dd>
    <dd>You are encouraged to share ideas and help each other but outright copying another's work (source code,
        documentation, etc.) will result in a zero score for all parties involved. Repeated offenses may result in
        referral for disciplinary action pursuant to the College guidelines for discipline in plagiarism matters. If you
        use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage media with you when you leave and don't
        leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the lab or store your files in publicly accessible
        network folders.</dd>

        <blockquote>
            When absences exceed twice the number of hours that a class meets in one week for full
            semester-length classes, the instructor may institute an excessive absence drop. For
            short-term classes, the number of acceptable absences is proportionately shorter.<br />
            Failure to attend the first class meeting may result in the student being dropped from
            the class.<br />It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to officially withdraw from any
            classes not attended and to discuss anticipated absences with the instructor.
