        As discussed in class, this course is designed, planned, and delivered as a face-to-face classroom course.
        The instructor has agreed to make an effort to accommodate students who are unable to attend class in person
        using the HyFlex model.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Students are encouraged to attend class in person whenever possible, but if you are unable to attend in person,
        it may be possible to attend class remotely using Zoom.

        The link for the Zoom meeting, when available will be the same as the office-hours link, listed in the syllabus
        as well as the course homepage.
