                    There are a number of methodologies associated with the software development lifecycle, but all are concerned 
                    with the roughly the same basic phases or stages.</p>

                    Read the assigned chapter, watch the embedded video, and read the (short) linked blog entry about the cost of 
                    finding and fixing defects.</p>

                    You have seen there are many phases and stages of software testing and that testing activities are continuous 
                    throughout the software project. The linked blog post highlights the cost impact and differentials of defects 
                    over time.

                    Taking all of this into consideration, what do you think the software programmer's role is in ensuring a quality 
                    software product, and what are some of the steps and activities a programmer should do with a defect-free, quality 
                    product as an objective?

                describing the programmer's activities and their contribution to the testing effort and any thoughts 
                and reactions from the assigned resources.

                (10+10 points) After posting, add a thoughtful response to at least two other student posts. Your replies 
                should be thoughtful, meaningful, and respectful class discussion replies of at least a paragraph. Be 
                constructive, stay on topic. I'm looking for something more meaningful than "great job" or "I agree."
