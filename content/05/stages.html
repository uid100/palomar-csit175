        <h2>Software Testing Stages</h2>
        <p>
            Software testing is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle. It ensures that 
            the software meets the specified requirements, works as expected, and is free from defects. 
            Software testing can be categorized into different phases and levels, each serving a specific 
            purpose in the testing process.
        </p>
        <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
        <p>
            In this phase, individual units or components of the software are tested in isolation.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose is to validate that each unit performs as designed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
        <p>
            Integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between different units/modules/components 
            to ensure they work together correctly. Test cases are designed to test interfaces, data flow, 
            and interactions between modules.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integration testing verifies that integrated units communicate and function as expected within 
                the larger system.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>System Testing</h3>
        <p>System testing evaluates the behavior of the entire system as a whole.</p>
        <p>It verifies that the software meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in the intended 
            environment. This phase may include functional testing, usability testing, performance testing, 
            security testing, and more.</p>
        <h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
        <p>Acceptance testing involves validating the software against the business requirements and user 
            expectations. It ensures that the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Software engineering often refers to this as <strong>V &amp; V</strong>, or verification and 
            validation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verification measures performance against each individual requirement.</li>
            <li>Validation assesses the system in its intended operational environment 
                to see that the needs of the user are met</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To put it another way:</p>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph" style="width: 50%; margin: auto; padding: 10px;">
            <p>Verification: did we build it right?</p>
            <p>Validation: did we build the right thing?</p>
        </div>
        <p>Testing is an important consideration of software development and testing activities begin from 
            the start of project. Testing activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviewing requirements for testability and test planning</li>
            <li>Reviewing system design for relevance against requirements and consideration of top-level objectives</li>
            <li>Reviewing development process and requirements management throughout system development</li>
            <li>Oversight of internal and customer acceptance testing activities</li>
            <li>Regression testing and requirements management through maintenance and support after deployment</li>
        </ul>
