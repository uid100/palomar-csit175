            <h3>Reading and Writing text files</h3>
            <p>
                File I/O stands for "File Input/Output." It refers to the process of reading data 
                from files or writing data to files on a computer's storage system. In programming, 
                file I/O operations allow programs to interact with files, which are essential for 
                tasks like storing data persistently, reading configuration files, processing large 
                datasets, and more.</p>
            <p>File I/O typically involves operations such as opening files, reading data from them, 
                writing data to them, closing files, and handling errors that may occur during these 
                operations. Python provides built-in functions to perform file I/O operations for 
                many different file types efficiently and securely.</p>
            <p>As you read in the book, there are important distinctions between working with text 
                and binary files. Binary files I/O is typically performed using precise <em>sized</em> 
                block read and write operations. In this module we won't consider those more advanced 
                data structures, and instead focus on text file operations for now.</p>

            <h3>Exceptions and Exception Handling</h3>
            <p>Exceptions in are unexpected or exceptional events that occur during the execution 
                of a program, which disrupt the normal flow of the program. These events can range 
                from simple errors, like dividing by zero or trying to access an invalid memory 
                location, to more complex issues such as network failures or file-not-found errors.</p>
            <p>When an exception occurs, the program can "throw" or "raise" the exception, indicating 
                that something went wrong. If the exception is not handled properly, it can cause the 
                program to terminate abruptly or produce incorrect results. To handle exceptions, most 
                programming languages provide mechanisms like try-catch blocks or exception handling 
                routines, which allow developers to gracefully manage unexpected situations and recover 
                from errors without crashing the program.</p>
            <p>Handling exceptions does not mean that your code will not encounter errors, but you can 
                improve the reliability and robustness of your software, by ensuring that it behaves 
                predictably even in the face of unforeseen circumstances.</p>
