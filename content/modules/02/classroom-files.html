# km2mi example from classroom discussion
# Program to convert kilometers to miles

# Good variable names is the first step to writing GOOD code.

# Variable declarations with clear, meaningful and descriptive names.
# They are initialized to declare the type of the variable.
kilometers = 0.0
miles = 0.0


# Constants should be defined in one place at the top of your code
# so that they can be easily maintained and updated as needed.
# Constants should be named in all caps with underscores between words.
MI_PER_KM = 0.62  # constant specified in requirements 4-Feb-2025
LOCAL_SALES_TAX = 8.45  # current local sale tax for XYZ county 3-Feb-2025


# use of clear and descriptive identifiers makes the code and logic easier
# to read and understand and less prone to errors.
kilometers = float(input("enter km: "))
