            <h3>Binary Files</h3>
            <p>Binary files contain data in a format that is not intended for human-readable interpretation. They store information in the form of sequences of bytes, which can represent any type of data, such as images, videos, executables, or structured data like database files.</p>
            <p>Example: A JPEG image file</p>
            <pre><code>
                FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01 ...
            </code></pre>
            <p>Reasons to choose binary files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficiency: Binary files are more efficient for storing complex data structures or large amounts of data.</li>
                <li>Performance: Reading and writing binary files can be faster compared to text files because there's no need for encoding or decoding.</li>
                <li>Data Integrity: Binary files preserve the exact data without any modifications, making them suitable for critical data storage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="txt">
            <h3>Text Files</h3>
            <p>Text files contain data that is structured as a sequence of lines or characters and are designed to be human-readable. They can store plain text or text-based formats such as CSV, JSON, XML, or source code.</p>
            <p>Example: A text file containing a list of names</p>
            <pre><code>
                John
                Alice
                Bob
                Emily
            </code></pre>
            <p>Reasons to choose text files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Human Readability: Text files are easy for humans to read and edit using any text editor.</li>
                <li>Interoperability: Text files can be easily shared and parsed across different platforms and programming languages.</li>
                <li>Configurability: Text files are commonly used for configuration files due to their simplicity and ease of editing.</li>

            <h3>How does binary code work?</h3>
            <p>This short video provides a brief description of different types of files and how they are stored. Both of these videos reference <em>hexadecimal</em> data. Hexadecimal is a number system which is another way of expressing values. It does not change the values, just displays them differently.</p>

            <h3>Binary data exercise: how to tell if a file is a jpeg?</h3>
            <p>This video describes working with binary files using code from another programming language. Watch (at least) the first 5 minutes of the video to learn more about how jpeg images are stored and identified. The rest of the video contains a code demo written in the C programming language. It may be of interest to you, but it is optional viewing.</p>

        <p>As we have seen, files may be stored in different types of formats. Recall in lab 01, you were reminded to set the configuration of your computer's file handler (File Explorer or Finder) to make sure that file extensions are visible. These file extensions usually hint at the type of data a file contains. Part of your computer's operating system configuration includes association instructions for the behavior of different file types. For instance, your computer might use Microsoft Word by default for opening a .docx document or Adobe Acrobat for .pdf files.</p>
        <p>For now, we are going to keep our file reading and writing programming challenges to text data formats.</p>
        <p>Text files which contain data meant to be processed by computers and programs, are usually formatted in a well-organized file formats which are easily read and parsed by the computer, but still human-readable.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Using the text book and other resources, investigate the descriptions of JSON, XML, and CSV files, their similarities and differences.</p>
        <ol style="padding: 10px;">
            <li>(30 points) In the space below, add your post, with at least 2 paragraphs describing these three different text file formats, and why you think any of these <em>standards</em> might be good choices to store data, rather than simple <em>free-form</em> text files, and what sort of data you might store with them. Use examples. <br /><span style="background-color: yellow;"> You should have your initial post complete by Friday night, to give other students an opportunity to respond. </span></li>
            <li>(10+10 points) After posting, add a thoughtful response to at least two other student posts, expanding or questions ideas from their posts. Your replies should be thoughtful, meaningful, and respectful class discussion replies of at least a paragraph. Be constructive, stay on topic. I'm looking for something more meaningful than "great job" and "I agree."</li>
