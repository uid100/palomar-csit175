        <h3>Final Module</h3>
        <p>
            There isn't enough time to explore everything in depth, but this course
            has hopefully given you a good introduction to the world of what is possible,
            and confidence in what you can achieve with computer programming and using 
            Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our focus was on providing knowledge and skills specific to using Python,
            but also on fostering problem-solving abilities and logical thinking that 
            can be applied in various contexts, including, of course, programming in
            other languages. The majority of what we covered is applicable not just to 
            the Python language, but to programming in general. In fact, if you go on to
            learn another programming language, you may be surprised at how much of what 
            you already know directly applies to the new language,
