            <h3 class="alert">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable and modular units called classes. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of a particular type of object.</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">Objects are instances of a class</p>
            <p>Objects are instances of a class, which means they are created based on the properties and behaviors defined in the class. An object can interact with other objects in the program and perform actions based on its defined behaviors.</p>
            <p>For example, if we have a class called "Car", it may have properties like "make", "model", and "color", as well as behaviors such as "start", "accelerate", and "stop". We can create multiple instances of the "Car" class as objects, each with their own unique values for the properties.</p>
            <p>Overall, classes and objects allow for code to be more organized, reusable, and modular in OOP, making it a popular programming paradigm used in many applications and software systems.</p>
            <ul>At the end of this module, you will be able to:
                <li>Write classes and instantiate objects from them</li>
                <li>Explain the role of a constructor in object-oriented programming</li>
            </ul>
