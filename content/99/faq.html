        <div id="textbook-edition" class="collapse" style="list-style: none; margin: 20px;">
            <p>Probably not. I have both the first and second editions. Both are good. The newer edition does have some updated content. In fact, programming languages do evolve over time, so there will be ongoing changes to the language. We will talk through the changes and discover other resources to use as well.</p>
            <p>Relative to other textbooks, this one is modestly priced, but you can probably find a used copy of the older edition and save some a few dollars. Be aware that buying used books online can take longer to arrive and the delay may not be worth the savings.</p>
            <p>The newer version is the one supported by the publisher and any updated materials.</p>

            <p>Yes! Actually, a stable Linux release would probably be ok too.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Really, either is fine, as long as you are comfortable using the system you choose.</p>
            <p>I actually get this question a lot. It is recommended that you have a reliable computer which runs <em>satisfactorily</em> with the latest updates and security patches installed.</p>
            <p>We will be using Python3, which has compatible releases for recent Windows, and Linux-based (including macos) computers. I regularly use both macos and windows (11) for development, test, and demonstration. The choice is up to you. It is expected that you are comfortable using whichever computer system that you choose.</p>
            <p>If your computer is <em>too old</em> or <em>too slow</em> by your own assessment, then you might want to consider upgrading to a newer machine of finding another to use for this class.</p>

        <div id="ide-v-text-editor" class="collapse" style="list-style: none; margin: 20px;">
            <p>Either is fine. I recommend using an IDE if you are new to programming. An IDE can help you manage your code files, provide syntax highlighting, and offer debugging tools that can make the coding process easier.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you are comfortable with a text editor and prefer its simplicity, that's perfectly acceptable as well. The key is to choose a tool that you feel comfortable with and that supports your learning style.</p>
            <p>Some popular IDEs for Python include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebook. For text editors, options like Sublime Text, Atom, or even Notepad++ can work well.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the choice between an IDE and a text editor comes down to personal preference and what helps you be most productive in your coding journey.</p>

            <p>Things happen. I'm pretty reasonable, but don't take advantage of me.</p>

            <p>kinda.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I do not grade on attendance.</p>
            <p>Class meetings are scheduled to help students better understand the curriculum and to help the instructor more effectively communicate ideas to students.</p>
            <p>I believe class participation is beneficial. I think that through our conversations, I can better assess how material is being received and understood. With feedback we can speed up and slow down through different topics within schedule boundaries.</p>
            <p>There are very good reasons for students electing to participate from a remote location. The HyFlex classroom is designed to support those students, but there is still an expectation that the student is responsible for hosting a suitable remote classroom environment, with adequate technical resources and as free from distractions as possible.</p>
