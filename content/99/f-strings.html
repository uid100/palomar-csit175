        <h2 class="alert">Formatting output using f-strings in Python</h2>
        <p>F-strings are a convenient and powerful feature in Python for formatting strings dynamically. They provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals, making string formatting more intuitive and efficient.</p>
        <h2>What are F-strings?</h2>
        <p>An F-string is a string literal prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. Within an F-string, expressions enclosed in curly braces '{ }' are evaluated at runtime, and their results are embedded into the string.</p>
        <h2>How to Use F-strings</h2>
        <p>To use F-strings, simply prefix a string literal with 'f' or 'F' and place expressions inside curly braces within the string. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
            name = "Alice"
            age = 30
            print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
        </code></pre>
        <p>This will output: <em>Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.</em></p>
        <h2>History of F-strings</h2>
        <p>F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6, which was released in December 2016. Since then, they have become increasingly popular due to their simplicity and efficiency in string formatting.</p>
        <p>With their ease of use and readability, F-strings have become a preferred method for string interpolation in Python, replacing older formatting methods like %-formatting and str.format().</p>
        <p>Overall, F-strings are a valuable addition to Python's arsenal of string manipulation tools, offering a more elegant and concise syntax for dynamic string formatting.</p>
