            <p class="card-text">In this module, we will explore the concepts of defining
            and using functions and modules in programming. Functions are essential building 
            blocks that allow us to encapsulate reusable code, while modules help organize 
            and structure our codebase for better maintainability.</p>

            <p>In software development, writing modular code is a fundamental practice aimed 
                at enhancing maintainability, scalability, and reusability of codebases. Modular 
                code refers to breaking down a program into smaller, self-contained units, or 
                modules, each responsible for specific tasks or functionalities. By organizing 
                code in this manner, developers can isolate concerns, facilitate collaboration, 
                and streamline the development process.</p>
            <p>Modular code follows the principle of "divide and conquer," where complex problems 
                are decomposed into simpler, manageable parts. Each module encapsulates a single 
                aspect of functionality, making it easier to understand, test, and maintain. 
                Additionally, modular code promotes code reusability, as modules can be reused 
                across different parts of an application or even in other projects.</p>
            <p>Key characteristics of modular code include <strong>loose coupling and high 
                cohesion</strong>. Loose coupling ensures that modules are independent and can 
                be modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the system, while high 
                cohesion implies that each module should have a clear and well-defined purpose, 
                with closely related functionalities grouped together.</p>
            <p>In this module, we'll explore the principles and best practices of writing modular 
                code, along with techniques for designing modular systems that promote flexibility, 
                extensibility, and robustness. By mastering the art of modular programming, 
                developers can build maintainable, scalable, and efficient software solutions 
                that meet the evolving needs of users and stakeholders.</p>
