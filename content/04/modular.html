            <h2>Chapter 4 How to define and use functions and modules</h2>
            <h3>Modular code</h3>
            <p>
                We've seen that Python has a pretty extensive library of built in methods that allow us to 
                get user input, convert text into numbers, display output on the console and do a variety 
                of other programming tasks. By having this built-in library of ready to use (and reuse) code, 
                it saves us the work of having to code all this from scratch.</p>
            <p>
                Chapter 4 takes us into developing user defined methods. Some languages also use the terms 
                function or procedure or subroutine when this topic comes up. We will discuss this as we 
                progress through the chapter.</p>
            <p>
                By breaking up our code into methods, we often get code we can (potentially) reuse in other 
                projects as well as allow multiple people to work on the same project. It also ties into the 
                concept of decomposing a problem into small pieces.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of Writing Modular code</h3>
            <h4>Maintainability</h4>
            <p>
                Breaking down a program into smaller, self-contained modules makes it easier to understand, 
                update, and debug. Developers can focus on a specific module without having to understand 
                the entire codebase, which reduces the risk of introducing unintended side effects when 
                making changes.</p>
            <h4>Scalability</h4>
            <p>
                Modular code allows developers to scale applications more efficiently. New features can be 
                implemented as separate modules, making it easier to integrate them into the existing codebase 
                without disrupting the entire system. This modular approach also facilitates parallel 
                development, where multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously.</p>
            <h4>Reusability</h4>
            <p>
                Modular code promotes code reusability by encapsulating common functionalities into reusable 
                modules. These modules can be easily imported and used in different parts of an application 
                or even in other projects, saving time and effort in development.</p>
            <h4>Collaboration</h4>
            <p>
                Modular code encourages collaboration among developers. Each module can be assigned to a 
                different developer or team, allowing for parallel development and easier integration of 
                contributions. Additionally, well-defined interfaces between modules facilitate communication 
                and coordination among team members.</p>
            <h4>Flexibility</h4>
            <p>
                Modular code provides flexibility in design and architecture. Developers can easily swap out 
                modules or replace them with more efficient implementations without affecting other parts of 
                the system. This flexibility enables applications to evolve and adapt to changing requirements 
                and technological advancements.</p>
            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>
                Modular code simplifies testing by isolating functionalities into separate units. Developers 
                can write unit tests for each module independently, ensuring that individual components work 
                correctly. This modular testing approach improves test coverage, reduces the likelihood of 
                regressions, and enhances the overall quality of the software.</p>
            <h3>Decomposing code into modules</h3>
            <p>
                An important, but sometimes misunderstood concept in software engineering are the goals of 
                writing code that is</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly-Cohesive</li>
                <li>Loosely-Coupled</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                You have seen why keeping code in smaller units is beneficial, but it is important to be sure 
                each unit of code contains:</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info"><em>all that it needs and nothing it doesn't.</em></p>
            <p>
                Make sure each of your functions does only one thing, and does not depend on anything outside 
                itself.</p>
            <p>
                High Cohesion: Imagine you have a group of friends who are all interested in playing soccer. 
                High cohesion among your friends means that they all share a common interest or purpose: playing 
                soccer. They stick together because they have a strong bond based on this shared interest. 
                Similarly, in programming, high cohesion refers to the idea that elements within a module are 
                closely related and work together to perform a single, well-defined task. Just like your 
                occer-playing friends, cohesive modules are tightly focused on a specific purpose, making them 
                easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.</p>
            <p>
                Loose Coupling: Now, let's say you have another group of friends who are interested in various 
                activities like playing soccer, watching movies, and cooking. Unlike the soccer-only group, this 
                group has loose coupling because each friend can pursue their interests independently without 
                relying heavily on the others. They are connected, but not tightly bound to each other. In 
                programming, loose coupling means that modules are independent of each other and interact through 
                well-defined interfaces or contracts. Changes in one module should not require extensive 
                modifications in other modules. This flexibility allows for easier maintenance, testing, and 
                modification of the codebase.</p>
            <p>
                In essence, high cohesion emphasizes the idea of "sticking together" within a module, while 
                loose coupling promotes a "hands-off" approach between modules, allowing them to interact 
                without being tightly intertwined. These principles help in creating modular, flexible, and 
                maintainable software systems.</p>
