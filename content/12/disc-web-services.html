    <h2>Web Services</h2>
    <p>
        As you have seen there are different ways of hosting and presenting data 
        on the web and many types of services running on the internet.</p>
    <p>
        As REST APIs commonly support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, 
        most require a user to be registered to use the service, often for a fee. A 
        simple web search will reveal many sources of free APIs that do not require 
        an API key to interact and access. You can search for some.</p>

    <p>There is a vast amount of data available on the internet. After investigating 
        some of these APIs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Propose an application (or more than one) that could make use of at least 
            3 of these APIs.
            <ul>
                <li>Who would be the target audience (user group)?</li>
                <li>Would this appeal to a large group of users or only be of special 
                    interest to a select few individuals?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                (30 points) In the space below, add your post, with at least 2 good paragraphs 
                describing your ideas, and why you think any of these might be an interesting 
                project.
            </p>
            <p class="boxed-paragraph" style="background-color: yellow;"> 
                You should have your initial post complete at least 24 hours before
                the due date to give other students an opportunity to respond.

                (5+5+5+5 points) After posting, add a thoughtful response to <strong>at 
                least four (4)</strong> other student posts, expanding or questions ideas 
                from their posts. Your replies should be thoughtful, meaningful, and 
                respectful class discussion replies of at least a paragraph. Be constructive, 
                stay on topic. I'm looking for something more meaningful than "great job" 
                and "I agree."
