<h2>Welcome to class!</h2>
<p>Hi everybody and welcome to CSIT-175!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in class. In the meantime, you have access to the 
    Canvas course.
</p>
<p>
    I will be posting and e-mailing announcements, with notes and reminders of class activities 
    such as due dates, quizzes, exams, lab hints, etc. Be sure you are using an email address 
    that is current in Canvas, and it's one you check regularly.
</p>
<p>
    We will be meeting this semester weekly on

    <span>Monday evenings at the Rancho Bernardo Education Center in SEC-416 on the 4th floor.</span>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Here are a few quick class orientation items to help everybody get started.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'll be going over all of this in class, but go ahead and get started now.</li>
    <li>The college has identified this as a class with a lab, but the separation is only 
        administrative. The lecture and lab are integrated as a single class and there is 
        nly one course in Canvas so only one place to look.</li>
    <li>The class container on Canvas is up! Please feel free to browse around the pages 
        to get familiar with where things are. I am always making updates and edits to 
        the class materials. If you notice any errors, broken links, missing images, or 
        something that just doesn't look right, please let me know!&nbsp; Click here for

    <li>We will cover installing Python and development tools in class. If you wish to work 
        on labs using Python IDLE Development tool on your personal computer, Python IDLE 
        is a free utility that installs with Python. We'll cover this in class too.</li>
    <li>Locate the class syllabus and outline. Be sure to review these right away.</li>
    <li>We will be starting the first week with chapter 1 in the text book. The class is 
        built with the 2nd Edition, but there is little difference. I do recommend the latest 
        version of the book, but if you have the older edition, or can find one used at a 
        discount, you will be just fine.</li>
    <li>Have a look at the first discussion activity, and get started with that. It's an 
        important exercise and it has points and a due date associated with it!</li>
    <li>Pay attention to due dates. My goal is to get timely feedback to you, but late 
        submissions make that much more difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go to Module 1 to get started!</li>
</ul>
